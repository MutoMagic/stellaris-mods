Why named Strike Group? Strike Group aims to widen the options given by ship design choices, to provide greater range and firepower.

Inspiration comes from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1345239366]'Tactical Ship Sections'[/url]. The difference is:

No technical research required.
Colossus can carry more weapons.
The Defensive Platform allows the construction of extra_large weapons.
As a super battleship, Titan should support more extra_large(4+2) weapons.
Spaceport adds large weapon modules.
The Printing House has made it possible for the Spaceport to produce influence.
Upper limit of influence can be added.

There may be naming conflicts on compatibility issues.
