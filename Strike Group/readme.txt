Why named Strike Group? Strike Group aims to widen the options given by ship design choices, to provide greater range and firepower.

Inspiration comes from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1345239366]'Tactical Ship Sections'[/url]. The difference is:

No need for technology research.
The Colossus no longer appears to be helpless in the face of enemy ships.
At the expense of protection, the Defensive Platform can use extra_large weapons.
Titan as a super battleship, should support more extra_large weapons.
Starbase can build large weapon modules.

There may be naming conflicts on compatibility issues.
